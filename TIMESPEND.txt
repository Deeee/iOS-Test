Total (7hrs 40mins ~ 10hrs 40mins)
Chat Section (1hr):
	-30mins on how to auto adjust cell height
	-30mins on how to make circular icon
Login Section (2hrs 10mins):
	-1hr on setting up asynchronous connection with server, 
	 while finished parsing the Json file received
	-40mins on popping alert window on main thread
	-30mins on customize alert window button function
Animation Section (4hrs 30mins ~ 6 hrs 30mins)
	-30mins on making required rotation animation
	-3~4hrs on making spread out and gather in icon animation
	-1~2hrs on researching how to make uiimageview start animation 
	 without snapping back to original position after being dragged,
	 end up with the conclusion that turning off the auto layout will
	 resolve the problem
Font setup and auto layout adjust (1 ~ 2hrs)
	-Putting app provided font with font info into info.list does 
	 not enable custom font somehow, only Machinato is usable.
Testing and debugging (1 ~ 2 hrs)
	-Found the bug where alert window provided segue leads to a "dead"
	 main view
	-Found the bug where POST request is sent without parameters
	-Found the bug where animation doesn't start from current state, then
	 I used the layer pause and resume function from Developer documentation

#IMPORTANT: 
	 For animation section, when animating on uiimageview "icon" in animation section,
	 if the icon has been dragged, the spread out animation will cause the icon snap back to 
	 its original position. After a long researching, the conclusion I have got is only turning 
	 off auto-layout will resolve the problem. If any other method is practical, please do 
	 let me know. The rotating does not cause the dragged icon go back to its original position, 
	 while I could remove the icon animation to make it seems un-bugged, but I really don't want 
 	 to waste the animation. :)
